Hello my name is Ben and if you are reading this then you are curious about me and what I can do.
I am a student programmer of sorts and enjoy puzzles
This folder is my dive into the basics of python through a book I found at my college library and through other challenges I have tackled using python
heres the book's website: https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/
I am excited to work professionally asap and am working on my skills constantly
Hope this helped,
Benjamin Wolbert
